This preview is showing the work I have been doing on a new graphic for a club called Pitt Tonight. As seen in my proposal, 
I had a lot to choose from regarding this final project. I am excited we were able to pick our own project ideas and run with 
it. I picked this because it is pulling from the visual argument unit. I thought that unit would be my favorite unit, but 
it quickly became my least favorite. I struggled a lot and got really frustrated with it easily. I really enjoy graphic design 
as well as photography, but I just could not figure out Gimp. Now that I have the ability to use programs I am more comfortable 
with (Photoshop and InDesign), I feel like I can execute this much better. This will be less of a visual argument and more of 
a graphic design, but I am excited to be using visual theory for this project! Right now, all I have is the background and 
graphic of the Cathedral, but as seen in the screenshots show, I am playing around with various fonts to add to the image!
