# Consolidation Unit Full Draft

Right now, this is a full draft of my consolidation unit project. This is a new graphic for the club I am a part of called Pitt Tonight. I have uploaded our old graphic to my repository to give a reference of what I am working with. My friends in the club and I have been talking for months about workshopping the old graphic, so I used this project to do it. I am pretty pleased with what I've come up with. I used Photoshop and InDesign heavily with this project because I understand it much better than I understand GIMP. With Photoshop, I edited the Cathy image to fit inside the cirlce. In InDesign, I created depth by placing the Cathy behind the crescent moon. The color scheme was chosen to go along with the new retro colors of Pitt. The crescent moon fits nicely into the circle to create cohesion, and the text is written on a path to fit on the inside line of the moon as well. I am pretty pleased with how it came out! I am awaiting feedback to see if I should add anything to the graphic and/or transfer the file to Photoshop so there is no white space behind the graphic and no confusion about what the piece is. There is a lot of negative space in the graphic itself (inside the circle), so I am willing to add to it as well!
