# Consolidation Unit

This is a new graphic for the club I am a part of called Pitt Tonight. I have uploaded our old graphic to my repository to give a reference of what I am working with. My friends in the club and I have been talking for months about workshopping the old graphic, so I used this project to do it. I am pretty pleased with what I've come up with. I used Photoshop and InDesign heavily with this project because I understand it much better than I understand GIMP. With Photoshop, I edited the Cathy image to fit inside the cirlce. In InDesign, I created depth by placing the Cathy behind the crescent moon. The color scheme was chosen to go along with the new retro colors of Pitt. The crescent moon fits nicely into the circle to create cohesion, and the text is written on a path to fit on the inside line of the moon as well. I took feedback into consideration and added texture to the moon part of the graphic. All I had to do was create another layer of just the moon, and add a grassy texture to it. I switched the file over to Photoshop, and made it a .png. I am very pleased with how it came out, and am looking forward to starting my portfolio!
