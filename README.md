# Consolidation Unit Proposal

I have several ideas I am going to be thinking about for the next few days. I am either going to rework my visual arguement or make an all new one. What I think I will end up doing is using the same concept for my visual arguement (the Pitt Tonight visual), but starting from scratch and using another application entirely. I want to use either PhotoShop or InDesign to try a more textual focus with this argument. It will focus more on design elements rather than pure visuals. I may even switch up the concept and make the argument an advertisement for one of our episodes instead of an ad to join the club. OR I might work on a new logo for the club altogether (these were all assignments I had in the club but never got to complete since school was cut a bit short). I am going to mainly fonts from Adobe, and potentially some club photos or school photos as well. I need to improve my PhotoShop and InDesign skills. I will be working by myself.
